The purpose of this assignment is to familarize yourself with the tools we will be using throughout this class.
Within the Secret Santa solution there are multiple projects. Two of the projects are web projects which can be launched (SecretSanta.Api and SecretSanta.Web).
When launched each of these project presents a default welcome message: "Hello from (project)". 

For this assignment you will be creating **two** pull requests. For each of the pull requests updated **one** of the project's welcome message (you get to decide what the message should be). Capture a screenshot of the web browser running the project. 

Each pull request should only contain the changes to one project. Each pull request should only contain the change to a single project's welcome message and a screenshot image.
